## 1) Analysis
In this experiment we are modelling population growth rate of _Esecheria coli_ in growth medium, with a specific interest in finding starting population size, carrying capacity and initial growth rate.
We used a logistic growth model for our data. Logistic growht can be described using a differential equation: dN/dT = Nr(1-N/K),
where N = current population size, r = instantaneous growth rate, K= carrying capacity of the system and t = time
SOlving this for population size at time t (N(t))in relation to the starting population size (N0), r and K gives us an equation we can use to plot a digital logistical growth curve:

N(t) = (K*N0*e^rt)/(K-N0+N0*e^rt)

When plotting, we see an initial exponential growth which slows down to reach equilibrium (when K is reached or N=K).



This **exponential** growth happens at the start when K is much greater than N (N=N0), and t is small.
simplifying our equation for this:

Nt = N0*e^rt

So we know that there is exponential growth at the start, when K>N0 and t is small
However, as t -> âˆž, N(t) -> K. In other words, as time tends to infinity / time passes, the population size at that time conforms to K.

Using our first observation, that there is exponential growth at the start, we can estimate the values of K, N0 and r in our data (data from file: experiment1.csv). This was done using a linear approximation:

We know that, at this time point: 
                                  
                                  Nt= N0*e^rt
                                  
                              ->  ln(Nt) = ln(N0) + rtln(e) 
                              
                                         = ln(N0) + rt
                                         
This fits the same form as the equation of a straight line y = c + bx

**Finding estimates for N0, K and r**

**Using a linear model** 
>- code in fit_linear_model.R

    Linear model 1: K >> N0, t is small 
  
    results:
    
      N0 = exp(6.8941709) (intercept of the regression e^N0)
      
      r = 0.01 (gradient of the regression model)
      

  
    Linear model 2: N(t) = K, t is large
  
    results:
    
      K = 5.79e10 (intercept of the regression)

## **2) Calculating population size at t = 4980 min, assuming that the population grows exponentially**

Exponential growth equation (as calculated earlier): Nt = N0*e^rt

We already know N0, r and t, substituting these into our exponential function (exponential_fun from plot_data_and_model.R).

at t = 4980, Nt = 4.187604e+24

Subsistuting these into our logistic function instead (Using logistic_fun() from plot_data_and_model.R) this is the answer I got:

at t = 4980 Nt = 5.79e+10

### How do the logistic and exponential functions compare

Clearly, population size is far larger at t - 4980 when using an exponential function than a logistic function. This is likely because, at this time, the logistic curve would have already reached an equilibrium (we can see visually that this is reached by around t = 2000, run the two ggplot functions in plot_data_and_model.R), whilst the exponential growht curve does not do this and continues growing indefinitely.

This is likely a less accurate depiction of the true population size at t = 4980, as exponential growht only occurs at the very start of a biotic growth period, and then this tapers off, so the logistic function likely better describes the true population sizew at this later time.
